1. Clarity and Organization: It was very easy to follow and it was well structured well done. 

2. Feature selcection and Jstuification- Yes all of the features made sense when trying to find the sale price. I like that you use 11 features to do it.

3.  yes they were all explained very well. Each one was told very well.

4. I thought the project was done very well and thought out.
