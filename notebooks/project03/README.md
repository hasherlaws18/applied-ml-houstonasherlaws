# Project 3 – Building a Classifier (Titanic Survival Prediction)

## Author: Houston Asher-Laws
## Date: November 9th 2025


This project builds and compares three machine learning classifiers — Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVC), and Neural Network (MLPClassifier) — using the Titanic dataset.
The goal is to predict passenger survival based on selected input features and evaluate each model’s performance.

### Objectives

Prepare and clean the Titanic dataset for modeling.

Build and evaluate classifiers using different input feature sets.

Compare performance across three model types.

Reflect on insights, accuracy, and predictive features.
